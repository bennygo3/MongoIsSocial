# MongoIsSocial

## Objective

This project is a backend API for a social networking app using MongoDB. The application will allow a user to create new users with a username, email and uniqueID. The created user can then add new friends, delete those friends, create new "thoughts", delete those thoughts, add comments to other users thoughts, and delete those comments. Created users will also have the capability to update their profile name, email, etc.
